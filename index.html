        <h3>My Project</h3>
        <p>This is my Connect 4 project I made in Python.  You can 
        download the game and try it out yorself!</p>
        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>There are two different versions of the game: one that is two player 
        and one with an AI that allows you to play against the computer.  To 
        make a move in the game you simply type what column you want to drop
        your tile into.  (The column numbers are indicated above the board.  The 
        board is them updated to show where your tile dropped to.  "R" indicates
        red tiles and "B" indicates black tiles.  The players alternate turns 
        until one player gets 4 in a row.  If the entire board fills up, and no
        one has on, the game ends in a tie.</p>
        <h3>The Code</h3>
        <p>One of the hardest things when making a terminal game like this one, 
        is making the game feel and look right with only the characters 
        avalible to you.  Internally, the board is stored as a two dimensional
        list, but when it is printed out, it is nicely formatted in to rows and
        columns so that it is easy for the user to play.  This is what an empty
        board looks like.</p>

        <p>The hardest part about making this game was designing the AI.  In 
        rule based games like this, AIs generally work by thinking ahead and 
        trying all the different possibilities.  The more steps they think ahead
        the smarter the AI is.  But this comes with a trade off.  As the number
        of steps increases, the number of calculations that the computer has to 
        do grows exponetially.  If the AI has to compute too many steps, it will
        take a really long time.  The AI in this game isn't very smart.  It only
        calculates two steps ahead.  It calculates if it can win on the next turn
        or if the other player can win on their next turn.</p>
