# Connect 4 Python Project

This is my Python connect 4 project.  You can download the code to try it out yourself!

### How to play
The game has a built in AI so you can play by yourself.  Just enter the slot 
number where you want to put your tile and the tile will drop down to the 
appropriate position.  To win the game, you need to get 4 in a row.  There is 
also a version of the game with no AI that you can play with two players.
